# Computer-Security
There are three projects about computer security.
First one is about Substitution Ciphers: Caesar, General ciphers
and Stream ciphers: XORing with a key-pad consisting of a repeating string, Key-pad consisting of pseudo-random symbols.

Second one is asked to use bit-flipping on an encrypted datum simulating a row of a database. There are two encryptions
of the same text below. One uses an 8B block-code DES with CBC. The other one uses a stream cipher.

Third one
