# roject 3 Computer Security       
This assumes that you have read the pen-testing module.     
By  Eastern, lucy.mscs.mu.edu  will  become  operable  on  port  80.     
Just  direct  your  browser  to lucy. There you will find a page that directs you to several webpages.         
All of them have easy to discern security problems. Find as many as possible and document exploits.         
By the way, I did not bother to get a certificate, so the connection is not secured via https.            
This actually makes it easier to use wireshark to observe the traffic between your machine and lucy.          
You can use all reasonable tools.
