# Project 1: Cracking Classical Codes
This project asks you to crack several classical codes. What you should learn from this is that
crypt-analysis is possible and that you do not know enough to invent your own codes. Other
than that, it is an intellectual exercise strengthening your capability to draw conclusions from
clues and to work towards a goal in a systematic manner. You can use any programming
language and any information you might find on the web. Just be careful about using code
downloaded from the web, you might be using products produced by newbies.
